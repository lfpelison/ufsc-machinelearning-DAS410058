## Webpage classification
### UFSC - DAS410058 - Jomi Fred Hubner

A data mining and machine learning task. (http://jomi.das.ufsc.br/ia/2017/tp-dm.pdf)
The task is based on html data, found in: `./webkb/` or http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/theo-20/www/data/

This data has to be classified in 7 target classes: 
* student (1641)
* faculty (1124)
* staff (137)
* department (182)
* course (930)
* project (504)
* other (3764)

And, the data is divided by universities:

* Cornell (867)
* Texas (827)
* Washington (1205)
* Wisconsin (1263)

--

To solve this problem, we made a **jupyter-notebook**, called `"web_classification.ipynb"`. Visualize it on `./web_classification.html`

*PS.* To get all the data and put on a csv (`./corpus.csv`), we made a python script (`./script.py`), that also is on the **jupyter-notebook**.

This project is to an academic discipline from Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina - http://jomi.das.ufsc.br/ia/
